Implement a Flutter app with bottom tabs (Ideas, IA

Lab, Settings). Add three wizards: LyricsWizard, ChordsWizard, MelodyWizard. Each wizard is 2–3

screens (input ® result ® confirm). Use Riverpod, just_audio, file_picker. Create mock services

calling /lyrics/suggest, /chords/suggest, /melody/generate.

Kiro uses generative AI. You may need to verify responses, code, and artifacts Kiro generates. See our Responsible AI Policy. Kiro processes data across all US Regions. Kiro may retain chats to provide and maintain the service.

Kiro may collect client-side telemetry and process content that may be used for service improvement. You can change this in Settings.

I'll help you implement a Flutter app with the specified structure. Let me first check the existing project structure and then create the Flutter app with bottom tabs, wizards, and the required dependencies.

Now I'll create the Flutter app structure. Let me start by setting up the main Flutter project structure in the frontend directory:

Searched workspace
Checking the current frontend directory structure
Searched workspace
Checking the musenote directory structure
Great! I can see there's already a Flutter project. Let me check the current pubspec.yaml and main.dart to understand the current setup:

Read file(s)

pubspec.yaml

main.dart
Perfect! Now I'll update the pubspec.yaml to include the required dependencies and then implement the complete Flutter app structure with bottom tabs and wizards.

Perfect! I've successfully implemented a complete Flutter app with the requested features. Here's a summary of what I've created:

✅ Complete Flutter App Implementation
Main Structure
Bottom Navigation with 3 tabs: Ideas, IALab, Settings
Riverpod for state management
Material Design 3 UI
Three AI Wizards (Each with 3 screens: Input → Result → Confirm)
🎵 Lyrics Wizard

Input: Theme, genre, mood, additional notes
Result: Generated lyrics with title and structure
Confirm: Save options and next steps
🎹 Chords Wizard

Input: Key, genre, mood, custom progression
Result: Chord progression and available chords grid
Confirm: Export options (PDF, MIDI)
🎼 Melody Wizard

Input: Genre, tempo, key, mood, duration slider
Result: Audio player with playback controls
Confirm: Export options (audio, MIDI)
Key Features
Mock Services calling /lyrics/suggest, /chords/suggest, /melody/generate
Audio Playback with just_audio (play/pause/seek controls)
File Operations with file_picker for exports
Freezed Models for type-safe API contracts
Error Handling with fallback to mock responses
Loading States with progress indicators
Technical Implementation
✅ Riverpod providers for each service
✅ Dio HTTP client with proper error handling
✅ Freezed data models for lyrics, chords, melody
✅ State management with StateNotifier pattern
✅ Navigation between wizard steps
✅ Responsive UI with proper form validation
